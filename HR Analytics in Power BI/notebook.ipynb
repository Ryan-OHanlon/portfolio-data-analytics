The second highest job role at risk of attrition is in our Human Resources department who are employed as a Recruiter at 37%.\n\nAnother cause of high attrition rate is how many years does an employee stay at our company. Employees that we employee before the first year have a 31% chance of leaving the company. That attrition rate increases to 34% in the first full year or employment. Digging deeper, we discovered that there is a relation to employees that art in the company less than two years are more often asked to perform Overtime. Reducing overtime from new hires could reduce the attrition rate %.\n\nBusiness travel is another factor of high attrition. While only 277 employees are categorized as Frequent Travellers, their attrition rate is at 24%. These frequent travellers are also correlated to working overtime and consisting primarily as Sales Representatives and Recruiters.\n\nAge group was another high factor of attrition with the biggest age group being staff between the age of 20 and 29. This age group consists of 40% of our total staff and has an attrition rate of 20.99%. This age group has a correlation to being part of the Sales and HR department, is with the company for less than two years and more likely to doing overtime.\n\nFinally, staff that perform overtime have an attrition rate of 30%. This has caused 127 of staff to leave the company. As stated before, Sales Representatives, Recruiters are more likely to work overtime. They also consist of half of our staff that has worked at our company for less than two years.\n\nTo reduce attrition, it is highly recommended to reduce the amount of overtime to create a better worklife balance for newly highered staff. It is also recommended to look deeper into the Sales and Human Resources department to find other correlation to the high attrition rate. The last recommendation is to look into business travel and what causes is resulting in a higher attrition rate for the frequent travellers in the company. By addressing these factors by making changes in our policy should reduce our attrition rate % for new highers, our sales and human resources departments, and our staff that work overtime.","metadata":{},"id":"079989a1-3d26-4a48-84a8-e421bac8b1a7","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## üì∑ Power BI screenshot\n![Screenshot](Datacamp_HRAnalysticsInPowerBI.png)","metadata":{},"id":"45d7fd25-0602-4fdd-a4e9-26297d145c0e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## ‚åõÔ∏è Time is ticking.
